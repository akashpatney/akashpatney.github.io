  <u><h1>About Me</h1></u>
  <br>



  <p id = "about">
    My name is Akash Patney, and I am currently a student at the 
    University of Michigan intending to major in computer science 
    and minor in mathematics. 

    <br>
    <br>

    For me, my interests in math and computer science started from a 
    younger age, largely - I belive - because I was drawn towards problem solving. Some distinct memories I have with these subjects include my
    first exposure to computer science with building a maze game on Scratch software (by MIT) and 
    working through my first competitive math problems in my middle school math club. While, over time, the complexity of my projects
    and learning experiences evolved I truly believe that these early experiences played a crucial role 
    in shaping my passions of today. 
    
    <br>
    <br>
    The projects that I have worked on today are of course more complex, but it is 
    the same excitement for seeing a project you create function as intended that motivates 
    me to continue pursuing computer science. Studying computer science has shown me how many useful applications can be created with just a computer, and I think that 
    is one of the most unique facets of computer science. 

    <br>
    <br>
    Outside of academics, my other interests include playing badminton, going to the gym to play basketball, and riding my 
    bicycle. I love being outdoors and spending time with friends and family. Staying active is important to me, and is a part 
    of my life that I intend to maintain.
