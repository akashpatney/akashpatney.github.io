  <u><h1>About Me</h1></u>
  <br>



  <p id = "about">
    My name is Akash Patney, and I am currently a student at the 
    University of Michigan majoring in computer science engineering 
    and minoring in mathematics. As of now, my goal is to work in either
    a software engineering or data science role. 

    <br>
    <br>
    Most recently, I worked as a software engineer intern at Ford Motor Company
    for the Dealer Information System Net Enabled team (DISNE). During this internship
    I worked with a variety of both front and backend technologies, including Java, Spring,
    Angular, DB2, Jenkins, and PCF. The primary goal of the developers on this team was to
    redesign a web application called DISNE, which was used to store information for car dealerships
    that Ford worked with. This was a positive experience for me, since it allowed me to see
    what it is like to work as a softare engineer in a professional environment for the first time. Gaining
    exposure to the common software engineering practices and applying the skills I have learned from school
    was really beneficial, and I hope to continue to build and develop my computer science skills. 

    

    <br>
    <br>

    When I first entered the University of Michigan, I knew that I wanted to puruse a quantitative major
    since I found that, before entering, mathematics was always a class I enjoyed. After taking introductory courses 
    in both computer science and mathematics, I realized that computer science was a good fit for my interests because it 
    holds a uniquely strong balance between having opporutnities which allow you to apply your knowledge to create practical applications,
    but also allowing for opporutnities to pursue challenging, theoretical problems - similar to the ones you would see in 
    mathematics. In fact, many of the foundations of computer science are grounded in rigorous mathematics. Among some of the courses
    I have taken include Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Learning, Proof Based Linear Algebra, and Cryptography. These courses 
    have significantly shaped my education so far, and have helped me in becoming both a better engineer and problem solver.   
    <br>
    <br>

    To gain experience applying some of the skills learned from school and to learn new ones, I have also dedicated time
    towards creating personal projects. This to me is one of the most exciting aspects of computer science. Given a foundation in 
    data structures and algorithms, the possibilities for creating unique projects are limitless. Not to mention, all of this can be 
    accomplished with just a laptop. I have highlighted some of these <a href="./projects.html">personal projects</a> on this website. Additionally,
    my <a href="https://github.com/akashpatney">github</a> contains the project code for many of these projects.  

    <br>
    <br>
    Outside of academics, my primary interests tend to revolve around being active. I enjoy going to 
    the gym, playing intramural sports offered through the University of Michigan, and spending time exploring new places.
