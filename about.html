  <u><h1>About Me</h1></u>
  <br>



  <p id = "about">
    My name is Akash Patney, and I am currently a student at the 
    University of Michigan majoring in computer science engineering 
    and minoring in mathematics. 

    <br>
    <br>

    Similar to most kids, growing up I had no concrete idea in my mind,
    as it relates to what exact career I would choose. I knew that, in school, I tended
    to be drawn more towards quantitative subjects, so - when I came to university -
    I decided to to pursue courses in computer science and mathematics. 

    <br>
    <br>

    Over the last few years, my education has contributed greatly towards my appreciation
    for both the practical and theoretical components of computer science, which often are established
    through a foundation of rigorous mathematics. In addition, I have taken coursework in several humanities courses,
    which I believe have been critical towards maintaining a well rounded perspective about the world.
    
    <br>
    <br>

    Ultimately, my joy for computer science stems from one particular aspect: <b> the ease of creation.</b> Studying computer science
    has equipped me with the skills to take an idea and launch it to become a tangible product almost seamlessly. This, I believe, to be the 
    primary reason why computer science has the power to be so impactful. There is certainly a steep learning curve, but a strong foundation 
    in data structures and algorithms opens infinitely many possibilities. 

    
    <br>
    <br>
    The projects that I have worked on continue to grow in complexity, but it is 
    the same excitement for seeing a project function as intended that motivates 
    me to continue pursuing computer science. Studying computer science has shown me how many useful applications can be created with just a computer, and I think that 
    is one of the most unique facets of computer science. 

    <br>
    <br>
    Outside of academics, my primary interests tend to revolve around being active. I enjoy going to 
    the gym, playing intramural sports offered through the University of Michigan, and spending time exploring new places.
