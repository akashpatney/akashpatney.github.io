  <u><h1>2022 - Basketball Analytics Project</h1></u><br>
  <p id = "desc"><b>Description:</b> This is the first ever project that I independently created. The goal of this project is to construct algorithms that attempt to accurately predict the outcomes of basketball games. While I initally intended for 
    this project to focus on the NBA, as I was developing the project, I realized that the program is not limited to the NBA, but could really actually work for any basketball game. In the future, my hope is to be able to expand 
    this project so that in addition to basketball, other sports are also added.
