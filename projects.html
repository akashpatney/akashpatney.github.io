  <!-- Reminder Project -->
  <br>
  <h1>2022 - Reminder App Project:</h1>
  <br>
  <h3>Skills Used: Kotlin, XML, Android Studio</h3>
  <br>
  <p id = "desc"><b><span class = "bdesc">Description:</span></b> The goal of this project was to create an android app that would store and display reminders from user input. 
  This project was my first time independently creating a project on Android Studio. Some valuable skills I learned through this project include learning how to use XML to structure the design of my 
  app and also understanding how to use the documentation made specific for android development.

  <!-- Basketball Analytics Project -->
  <br>
  <h1>2022 - Analytics Project:</h1>
  <br>
  <h3>Skills Used: C++, Visual Studio</h3>
  <br>
  <p id = "desc"><b><span class = "bdesc">Description:</span></b> The purpose of this project was to construct algorithms that take input data to attempt to accurately predict the outcomes of basketball games. The project uses mathematical calculations to determine 
    statistics strongly correlated with winning outcomes and to also compare respective teams in matchups. While I initally intended for 
    this project to focus on the NBA, as I was developing the project, I realized that the program is not limited to the NBA, but could really actually work for any basketball game. In the future, my hope is to be able to expand 
    this project so that in addition to basketball, other sports are also added.

  <!-- Portfolio Project-->
  <h1>2022 - Portfolio Project:</h1>
  <br>
  <h3>Skills Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, VS Code</h3>
  <br>
  <p id = "desc"><b><span class = "bdesc">Description:</span></b> In this project, I utilized HTML, CSS, and Javascript
    to develop a website that could display information about
    my projects and my interest in computer science. I made a specific effort to learn how to build a website that was responsive,
    as I wanted the site to be accessible on all devices. This project taught me the importance of organized code. By writing useful comments
    throughout my code I was able to troubleshoot problems easier, which is a skill that is highly applicable to computer science projects.
