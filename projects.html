    <!-- VR Project -->
    <br>
    <h1>2025 - Augmented Reality Ann Arbor Go</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>Skills Used: Unity, C#, Visual Studio, JIRA, Mixamo</h3>
    <br>
    <p id = "desc"><b><span class = "bdesc">Description:</span></b> This project was the second major project of
    my CSE capstone class EECS 440 - Extended Reality for Social Impact. The goal of this project was to create a
    variant of the popular game Pokemon Go, but - instead of Pokemon - the game would take on the theme of the city
    of Ann Arbor. The focus of this project was on using Augmented Reality to make the game more interactive.

  <!-- VR Project -->
  <br>
  <h1>2025 - Virtual Reality Computer Lab</h1>
  <br>
  <h3>Skills Used: Unreal Engine 5, Blueprints, JIRA, Meta Quest Pro</h3>
  <br>
  <p id = "desc"><b><span class = "bdesc">Description:</span></b> This project was the first of three projects for my CSE 
  capstone class called EECS 440 - Extended Reality for Social Impact. The goal of this project was to recreate a computer
  lab that is located at the University of Michigan in a building called the BBB (Bob Betty Beyster), alongside
  also replicating several interactions that aim to capture the experience as a CSE student at the
  University of Michigan.

  <!-- Reminder Project -->
  <br>
  <h1>2022 - Reminder App Project:</h1>
  <br>
  <h3>Skills Used: Kotlin, XML, Android Studio</h3>
  <br>
  <p id = "desc"><b><span class = "bdesc">Description:</span></b> The goal of this project was to create an android app that would store and display reminders from user input.
  This project was my first time independently creating a project on Android Studio. Some valuable skills I learned through this project include learning how to use XML to structure the design of my
  app and also understanding how to use the documentation made specific for android development.

  <!-- Basketball Analytics Project -->
  <br>
  <h1>2022 - Analytics Project:</h1>
  <br>
  <h3>Skills Used: C++, Visual Studio</h3>
  <br>
  <p id = "desc"><b><span class = "bdesc">Description:</span></b> The purpose of this project was to construct algorithms that take input data to attempt to accurately predict the outcomes of basketball games. The project uses mathematical calculations to determine
    statistics strongly correlated with winning outcomes and to also compare respective teams in matchups. While I initally intended for
    this project to focus on the NBA, as I was developing the project, I realized that the program did not have to be limited to the NBA, but could really actually work for any basketball game. In the future, my hope is to be able to expand
    this project so that in addition to basketball, other sports are also added.

  <!-- Portfolio Project-->
  <h1>2022 - Portfolio Project:</h1>
  <br>
  <h3>Skills Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, VS Code</h3>
  <br>
  <p id = "desc"><b><span class = "bdesc">Description:</span></b> In this project, I utilized HTML, CSS, and Javascript
    to develop a website that could display information about
    my projects and my interest in computer science. I made a specific effort to learn how to build a website that was responsive,
    as I wanted the site to be accessible on all devices. Through making the website responsive, I learned how to make webpages dynamic
    instead of static by incorporating Javascript.
