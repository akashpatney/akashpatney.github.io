        This project was the capstone project of my MDE class EECS 440 - Extended Reality for Social Impact. This app is aimed at promoting social emotional learning amongst children. The app includes two modes: story mode and express mode. In story mode, the user travels the room searching for characters, and unlocks them by guessing the emotion of the character correctly. In express mode, the user is presented with a prompt and tasked with making an expression that aligns with the scenario, which the facial recognition technology then assess. Correctly creating the expression awards the user points, which can be used for purchasing AR acessories.

        This project was the second major project of my CSE capstone class EECS 440 - Extended Reality for Social Impact. The goal of this project was to create a variant of the popular game Pokemon Go, but - instead of Pokemon - the game would take on the theme of the city of Ann Arbor. The focus of this project was on using Augmented Reality to make the game more interactive.

        This project was the first of three projects for my CSE capstone class called EECS 440 - Extended Reality for Social Impact. The goal of this project was to recreate a computer lab that is located at the University of Michigan in a building called the BBB (Bob Betty Beyster), alongside also replicating several interactions that aim to capture the experience as a CSE student at the University of Michigan.

      </div>
      <p class="project-desc" id="desc-4" style="display:none;">
        The goal of this project was to create an android app that would store and display reminders from user input. This project was my first time independently creating a project on Android Studio. Some valuable skills I learned through this project include learning how to use XML to structure the design of my app and also understanding how to use the documentation made specific for android development.

        The purpose of this project was to construct algorithms that take input data to attempt to accurately predict the outcomes of basketball games. The project uses mathematical calculations to determine statistics strongly correlated with winning outcomes and to also compare respective teams in matchups. While I initally intended for this project to focus on the NBA, as I was developing the project, I realized that the program did not have to be limited to the NBA, but could really actually work for any basketball game. In the future, my hope is to be able to expand this project so that in addition to basketball, other sports are also added.

      <p class="project-desc" id="desc-6" style="display:none;">
        In this project, I utilized HTML, CSS, and Javascript to develop a website that could display information about my projects and my interest in computer science. I made a specific effort to learn how to build a website that was responsive, as I wanted the site to be accessible on all devices. Through making the website responsive, I learned how to make webpages dynamic instead of static by incorporating Javascript.
