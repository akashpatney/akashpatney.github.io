  <u><h1>About Me</h1></u>
  <br>

  <p id = "about">
    Hi! My name is Akash Patney, and I am currently a student at the
    University of Michigan majoring in computer science engineering. 
    As of now, my goal is to pursue a career in software engineering.

    <br>
    <br>
    In the past two summers, I have done software engineering internships at Ford Motor Company.
    Most recently, I worked as a software engineer intern in the Supply Chain group where we were responsible for
    managing and processing data for Ford's suppliers. I gained experience with a variety of tools including
    several of GCP's Big Data cloud services (Google Dataflow, Google Pub/Sub, Google Big Query, etc.), Apache
    Beam paired with Java, and several deployement and configuration tools such as Terraform, Tekton, and YAML.
    The primary project I worked on was related to taking the data aggregation pipelines that currently
    existed for supplier data and replacing them with a single Google Data Flow Job. This replacement 
    offered numerous advantages over the previous structure of the pipelines including a consolidation of
    the logic for the data aggregation, lower runtimes and costs, the ability to version control, and
    the ability to test the code.


    <br>
    <br>
    In the summer before the most recent, I worked as a full stack software engineer intern at Ford Motor Company
    for the Dealer Information System Net Enabled team (DISNE). During this internship
    I worked with a variety of both front and backend technologies, including Java, Spring,
    Angular, DB2, Jenkins, and PCF. The primary goal of the developers on this team was to
    redesign a web application called DISNE, which was used to store information for car dealerships
    that Ford worked with. This was a positive experience for me, since it allowed me to see
    what it is like to work as a softare engineer in a professional environment for the first time. Gaining
    exposure to the common software engineering practices and applying the skills I have learned from school
    was really beneficial, and I hope to continue to build and develop my computer science skills.

    <br>
    <br>

    To gain experience applying some of the skills learned from school and to learn new ones, I have also dedicated time
    towards creating personal projects. I have highlighted some of these <a href="./projects.html">personal projects</a> on this website. Additionally,
    my <a href="https://github.com/akashpatney">github</a> contains the project code for many of these projects.
